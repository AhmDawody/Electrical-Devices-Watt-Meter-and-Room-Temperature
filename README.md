# Electrical-Devices-Watt-Meter-and-Room-Temperature
This project is a simple and affordable way to monitor room temperature and the power consumption of electrical devices using a single microcontroller board. The system is designed to measure the real-time power consumption of devices, allowing users to analyze and optimize their energy usage patterns.
